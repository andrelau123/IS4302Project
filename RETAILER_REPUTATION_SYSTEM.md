# Enhanced Multi-Factor Retailer Reputation System

## Overview

The upgraded `RetailerRegistry` contract now implements a sophisticated **multi-factor reputation system** that evaluates retailers based on six key performance indicators, replacing the previous simple success-rate calculation.

## Key Features

### 🎯 **Composite Reputation Score (0-1000)**
Retailers receive a weighted composite score based on multiple factors, providing a holistic view of their performance and reliability.

### 📊 **Six Reputation Factors**

#### 1. **Success Rate (40% weight)**
- **What it measures**: Percentage of successful verifications vs. failed verifications
- **Scoring**: 
  - 100% success = 1000 points
  - 0% success = 0 points
  - New retailers start at 500 (neutral)
- **Impact**: PRIMARY factor - demonstrates core competency

#### 2. **Volume (15% weight)**
- **What it measures**: Total number of products handled over lifetime
- **Scoring**: 
  - 100+ products = 1000 points
  - Linear scaling below threshold
- **Impact**: Rewards high-performing, established retailers
- **Configurable**: Threshold adjustable by admin

#### 3. **Tenure (10% weight)**
- **What it measures**: Time since retailer registration
- **Scoring**: 
  - 365+ days = 1000 points
  - Linear scaling for newer retailers
- **Impact**: Recognizes experience and longevity
- **Configurable**: Threshold adjustable by admin

#### 4. **Response Time (10% weight)**
- **What it measures**: Average time to respond to requests
- **Scoring**: 
  - ≤ 1 day = 1000 points
  - 2x optimal (2 days) = 500 points
  - 3x+ optimal = 0 points
- **Impact**: Rewards operational efficiency
- **Algorithm**: Uses weighted moving average (70% old, 30% new)
- **Configurable**: Optimal time adjustable by admin

#### 5. **Dispute History (15% weight)**
- **What it measures**: Win rate in disputes raised against retailer
- **Scoring**: 
  - 0 disputes = 1000 points (perfect)
  - 100% dispute win rate = 1000 points
  - 0% dispute win rate = 0 points
- **Impact**: Reflects quality and fairness in operations
- **Integration**: Can be called from DisputeResolution contract

#### 6. **Consistency Bonus (10% weight)**
- **What it measures**: Consecutive successful verifications
- **Scoring**: 
  - 10+ consecutive successes = 1000 points
  - Linear scaling below threshold
  - Resets to 0 on any failure or dispute loss
- **Impact**: Rewards sustained excellent performance
- **Configurable**: Threshold adjustable by admin

## Advanced Features

### 🕐 **Reputation Decay System**
- **Purpose**: Prevents inactive retailers from maintaining high scores
- **Mechanism**: 
  - No decay for active retailers (activity within 90 days)
  - 5% decay per 90-day period of inactivity
  - Caps at 50% maximum decay
- **Activity triggers**: Any verification, product handling, or recorded metric
- **Configurable**: Period and rate adjustable by admin

### 📈 **Dynamic Weighting**
- All factor weights are configurable by governance
- Default weights:
  ```
  Success Rate:  40% (4000 bps)
  Volume:        15% (1500 bps)
  Tenure:        10% (1000 bps)
  Response Time: 10% (1000 bps)
  Dispute:       15% (1500 bps)
  Consistency:   10% (1000 bps)
  ─────────────────────────────
  Total:        100% (10000 bps)
  ```

### 💰 **Economic Contribution Tracking**
- Tracks lifetime revenue generated by retailer
- Currently informational; can be integrated into future scoring

## Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: New Retailer**
- Starts with 500/1000 reputation (neutral)
- As they handle products and complete verifications:
  - Success rate improves → +points
  - Volume increases → +points
  - Tenure grows → +points
  - Can quickly reach 800+ with good performance

### **Scenario 2: Established Top Performer**
- 200+ products handled ✓
- 98% success rate ✓
- 2+ years tenure ✓
- Average 8-hour response time ✓
- 0 disputes ✓
- 25 consecutive successes ✓
- **Result**: 950-1000/1000 reputation

### **Scenario 3: Declining Retailer**
- Was good (800/1000) but became inactive
- After 6 months inactivity: 760/1000 (5% decay)
- After 1 year inactivity: 720/1000 (10% decay)
- Returns and shows poor performance: Further drops

### **Scenario 4: Dispute Impact**
- Retailer has 900/1000 reputation
- Loses a dispute → consistency bonus resets
- Dispute factor drops from 1000 → 500 (if 50% win rate)
- **Result**: Drops to ~820/1000
- Must rebuild trust through consistent performance

## Governance Considerations

### **Adjusting Weights**
The DAO/governance can adjust weights to reflect business priorities:
- **Brand protection focus**: Increase dispute weight to 25%
- **Efficiency focus**: Increase response time weight to 20%
- **Volume focus**: Increase volume weight to 25%

### **Threshold Tuning**
- Volume threshold can be lowered for niche markets (e.g., 50 instead of 100)
- Tenure threshold can be adjusted for new market entries
- Response time can be stricter for premium brands
