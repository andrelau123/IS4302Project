## Token Economics

### AUTH Token Utility

**Primary Functions:**
1. **Verification Fees** - Consumers pay to verify product authenticity
2. **Staking** - Verification nodes stake tokens for eligibility
3. **Governance** - Vote on protocol parameter changes
4. **Rewards** - Earn staking rewards and verification fees

### Economic Model

**Verification Fee Structure:**
```
Total Fee = Base Fee (0.01 ETH) + (Product Value × 2.5%)

Distribution:
├─ Verifier: 60%
├─ Brand: 25%
└─ Treasury: 15%
```

**Staking Rewards:**
- APY: 8% (adjustable 5-20%)
- Lock Period: 7 days minimum
- Reward Pool: 30% of total supply
- Sustainable distribution model

**Anti-Speculation Measures:**
- Utility-focused design (tokens required for services)
- Staking reduces circulating supply
- Graduated fees favor regular use
- Supply cap prevents inflation

## Data Flow Architecture

### Product Journey

```
1. MANUFACTURING
   └─ Manufacturer registers product
   └─ Unique ID generated
   └─ Metadata stored on IPFS
   └─ Initial ownership recorded

2. DISTRIBUTION
   └─ Transfer to authorized distributor
   └─ IoT sensors monitor conditions
   └─ Location checkpoints recorded
   └─ Oracle data aggregated

3. RETAIL
   └─ Handoff to authorized retailer
   └─ Verification performed
   └─ Reputation updated
   └─ Consumer access enabled

4. CONSUMER
   └─ Final verification before purchase
   └─ Ownership transfer recorded
   └─ Optional NFT minting for premium items
   └─ Secondary market tracking begins
```

## Oracle Reliability Mechanisms

### Multi-Source Verification
- **IoT Sensors:** Temperature, humidity, shock, GPS (hardware layer)
- **Human Checkpoints:** Quality control, customs, delivery confirmation
- **Cryptographic Seals:** Tamper-evident packaging with blockchain anchoring

### Economic Security
- **Verifier Staking:** 0.1 ETH minimum stake requirement
- **Slashing:** 10% penalty for timeouts or false verifications
- **Dispute Bonds:** 0.1 ETH to raise disputes (refunded if correct)
- **Arbiter Rewards:** Economic incentive for honest arbitration

### Redundancy & Consensus
- **Weighted Quorum:** 60% of oracle weight must agree
- **Multiple Sources:** Trusted (high weight) + permissionless (low weight)
- **Dispute Resolution:** Multi-arbiter voting for contested verifications
- **Reputation System:** Track oracle accuracy over time

## Data Privacy & Segregation

### Privacy Protections

**Manufacturer Data:**
- Proprietary manufacturing processes kept off-chain
- Only essential verification data on blockchain
- Encrypted metadata with access controls

**Consumer Data:**
- Minimal personal information collection
- Pseudonymous blockchain addresses
- Optional identity disclosure for warranties

**Commercial Data:**
- Retailer performance data segregated by brand
- Competitive information isolated
- Aggregated statistics only for analytics

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions (9 distinct roles)
- Brand-specific authorization boundaries
- Encrypted off-chain storage with IPFS
- On-chain hashes for verification only
