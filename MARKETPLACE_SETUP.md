### Step 2: Connect to the App
1. Open http://localhost:3000/marketplace
2. Click "Connect Wallet" if not already connected
3. Select your account in MetaMask
4. Ensure you're on "Hardhat Local" network

### Step 3: Purchase an NFT
1. Browse the NFT listings
2. Click "Buy Now" on any NFT
3. MetaMask will pop up requesting:

6. Success! 🎉

## 💰 Transaction Flow

When you click "Buy Now":

1. **Frontend** calls `marketplace.purchaseNFT(tokenId)` with `value: price`
2. **Marketplace Contract**:
   - Verifies NFT is listed
   - Calculates platform fee (2.5%)
   - Transfers NFT to you
   - Pays seller (97.5% of price)
   - Pays platform fee (2.5% to FeeDistributor)
3. **You receive** the NFT
4. **Seller receives** ETH payment
